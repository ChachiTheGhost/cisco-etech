\subsection{IoT Edge and Fog Computing}
A new term which is becoming more popular in the IoT space is ``fog''
computing. It is sometimes referred to as ``edge'' computing outside of Cisco
environments, which is a more self-explanatory term. Fog computing distributes
storage, compute, and networking from a centralized cloud environment closer
to the users where a given service is being consumed. The drivers for edge
computing typically revolve around performance, notably latency reduction, as
content is closer to users. The concept is somewhat similar to Content
Distribution Networking (CDN) in that users should not need to reach back to a
small number of remote, central sites to consume a service. \\

Cisco defines fog computing as an architecture that \textit{extends the Compute,
Networking, and Storage capabilities from the Cloud to the Edge of IoT
networks.} The existence of fog computing is driven, in large part, by the
shift in dominant endpoints. Consumer products such as laptops, phones, and
tablets are designed primarily for human-to-human or human-to-machine
interactions. Enterprise and OT products such as sensors, smart objects, and
clustered systems primarily use machine-to-machine communications between one
another and/or their controllers, such as an MRP system. As such, many of
these OT products deployed far away from the cloud need to communicate
directly, and in a timely, secure, and reliable fashion. Having compute,
network, and storage resources closer to these lines of communication helps
achieve these goals. \\

Fog computing is popular in IoT environments not just for performance reasons,
but consumer convenience. Wearing devices that are managed/tethered to other
personally owned devices are a good example. Some examples might be smart
watches, smart calorie trackers, smart heart monitors, and other wearable
devices that ``register'' to a userâ€™s cell phone or laptop rather than a large
aggregation machine in the cloud. \\

With respect to cost reduction when deploying a new service, comparing
``cloud'' versus ``fog'' can be challenging and should be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis. If the cost of backbone bandwidth from the edge to the
cloud is expensive, then fog computing might be affordable despite needing a
capital investment in distributed compute, storage, and networking. If transit
bandwidth and cloud services are cheap while distributed compute/storage
resources are expensive, then fog computing is likely a poor choice. That is
to say, fog computing will typically be more expensive that cloud
centralization. \\

Finally, it is worth noting the endless cycle between the push to centralize
and decentralize. Many technical authors (Russ White in particular) have noted
this recurring phenomenon dating back many decades. From the mainframe to the
PC to the cloud to the fog, the pendulum continues to swing. The most
realistic and supportable solution is one that embraces both extremes, as well
as moderate approaches, deploying the proper solutions to meet the business
needs. A combination of cloud and fog, as suggested by Cisco and others in the
IoT space, is likely to be the most advantageous solution.

\subsubsection{Data Aggregation}
Data aggregation in IoT is a sizable topic with a broad range of techniques
across the layers of the OSI model. Cisco states that \textit{data filtering,
aggregation, and compression are performed at the edge, in the fog, or at the
center.} Aggregation of data is a scaling technique that reduces the amount of
traffic transmitted over the network, often times to conserve bandwidth,
power, and storage requirements. A simple example includes logging. If
hundreds of sensors are all in a healthy state, and report this in their
regular updates, a middle-tier collector could send a single message upstream
to claim ``All the sensors from my last update are still valid. There is
nothing new to report.'' \\

Because IoT devices are often energy constrained, much of the data aggregation
research has been placed in the physical layer protocols and designs around
them. The remainder of this section discusses many of these physical layer
protocols/methods and compares them. Many of these protocols seek to maximize
the network lifetime, which is the elapsed time until the first node fails due
to power loss.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Direct transmission:} In this design, there is no aggregation
  or clustering of nodes. All nodes send their traffic directly back to the
  base station. This simple solution is appropriate if the coverage area is
  small or it is electrically expensive to receive traffic, implying that a
  minimal hop count is beneficial.
  \item \textbf{Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH):} LEACH
  introduces the concept of a ``cluster'', which is a collection of nodes in
  close proximity for the purpose of aggregation. A cluster head (CH) is
  selected probabilistically within each cluster and serves as an aggregation
  node. All other nodes in the cluster send traffic to the CH, which
  communicates upstream to the base station. This relatively long-haul
  transmission consumes more energy, so rotating the CH role is advantageous
  to the network as a whole.  Last, it supports some local
  processing/aggregation of data to reduce traffic sent upstream (which
  consumes energy). Compared to direct transmission, LEACH prolongs network
  lifetime and reduces energy consumption.
  \item \textbf{LEACH-Centralized (LEACH-C):} This protocol modifies LEACH by
  centralizing the CH selection process. All nodes report location and energy
  to the base station, which finds average of energy levels. Those with above
  average remaining energy levels in each cluster are selected as CH. The base
  station also notifies all other nodes of this decision. The CH may not
  change at regular intervals (rounds) since the CH selection is more
  deliberate than with LEACH. LEACH distributes the CH role between nodes in a
  probabilistic (randomized) fashion, whereby LEACH-C relies on the base
  station to make this determination. The centralization comes at an energy
  cost since all nodes are transmitting their current energy status back to
  the base station between rounds. The logic of the base station itself also
  becomes more complex with LEACH-C compared to LEACH.
  \item \textbf{Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficiency Network (TEEN):} This
  protocol differs from LEACH in that it is reactive, not proactive. The radio
  stays off unless there is a significant change worth reporting. This implies
  there are no periodic transmissions, which saves energy. Similar to the
  LEACH family, each node becomes the CH for some time (cluster period) to
  distribute the energy burden of long-haul communication to the base station.
  If the trigger thresholds are not crossed, nodes have no reason to
  communicate. TEEN is excellent for intermittent, alert-based communications
  as opposed to routine communications. This is well suited for event-driven,
  time sensitive applications.
  \item \textbf{Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Info Systems (PEGASIS):}
  Unlike the LEACH and TEEN families, PEGASIS is a chain based protocol. Nodes
  are connected in round-robin fashion (a ring); data is sent only to a node's
  neighbors, not to a CH within a cluster. These short transmission distances
  his further minimize energy consumption. Rather than rotate the burdensome
  CH role, all nodes do a little more work at all times. Only one node
  communicates with the base station. This allows nodes to determine which
  other nodes are closest to them. Discovery is done by measuring the receive
  signal strength indicator (RSSI) of incoming radio signals to find the
  closest nodes. PEGASIS is optimized for dense networks.
  \item \textbf{Minimum Transmission of Energy (MTE):} MTE is conceptually
  similar to PEGASIS in that it is a chain based protocol designed to minimize
  the energy required to communicate between nodes. In contrast with direct
  transmission, MTE assumes that the cost to receive traffic is low, and works
  well over long distances with sparse networks. MTE is more computationally
  complex than PEGASIS, again assuming that the energy cost of radio
  transmission is greater than the energy cost of local processing. This may
  be true in some environments, such as long-haul power line systems and
  interstate highway emergency phone booths.
  \item \textbf{Static clustering:} Like the LEACH and TEEN families, static
  clustering requires creating geographically advantageous clusters for the
  purpose of transmission aggregation. This technique is static in that the CH
  doesn't rotate; it is statically configured by the network designer. This
  technique is useful in heterogeneous environments where the CH is known to
  be a higher energy node. Consider a simple, non-redundant example. Suppose
  that each building has 20 sensors, 1 of which is a more expensive variant
  with greater energy capacity. The network is heterogeneous because not all
  20 nodes are the same, and thus statically identifying the most powerful
  node as the permanent CH may extend the network lifetime.
  \item \textbf{Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC):} Similar to
  static clustering, the DEEC family of protocols is designed for
  heterogeneous networks containing a mix of node types. DEEC introduces the
  concept of ``normal'' and ``advanced;; nodes, with the latter having greater
  initial energy than the former. Initial energy is assigned to normal nodes,
  with a little more initial energy assigned to advanced nodes. CH selection
  is done based on whichever node has the largest initial energy. As such,
  advanced nodes are more likely to be selected as the CH.
  \item \textbf{Developed DEEC (DDEEC):} A newer variant of DEEC, DDEEC
  addresses the concern that advanced nodes become CH more often, and will
  deplete their energy more rapidly. At some point, they'll look like normal
  nodes, and should be treated as such as it relates to CH selection. Making a
  long-term CH decision based on initial energy levels is can reduce the
  overall network lifetime. DDEEC improves the CH selection process to
  consider initial and residual (remaining) energy in its calculation.
  Enhanced DEEC (EDEEC) further extends DDEEC by adding a third class of
  nodes, called ``super'' nodes, which have even greater initial energy than
  advanced nodes. Its operation is similar to DDEEC otherwise.

Note that many of these protocols are still under extensive development,
research, and testing.

\subsubsection{Edge Intelligence}
Cisco products relevant to the fog computing space include small Wi-Fi/LTE
routers (Cisco IR 819/829 series) and programmable RF gateways (IR910). These
devices bring all the power of Cisco IOS software in a small form factor
suitable for industrial applications. As with many IoT topics, demonstrating
edge intelligence is best accomplished with a real-life example. Edge
intelligence often refers to distributed analytics systems that can locally
evaluate, reduce/aggregation, and act on sensor data to avoid expensive
backhaul to a centralized site. It can also generically refer to any
intelligent decision making at the network edge (where the sensors/users are),
which is discussed in the example below. \\

The author personally used the IR 819 and IR 829 platforms in designing a
large, distributed campus area network in an austere environment. The IR 819s
were LTE-only and could be placed on vehicles or remote facilities within a
few kilometers of the LTE base station. The IR 829s used LTE and Wi-Fi, with
Wi-Fi being the preferred path. This allowed the vehicles equipped with IR
829s to use Wi-Fi for superior performance when they were very close to the
base station (say, for refueling or resupply). Both the IR 819 and IR 829
equipped vehicles had plug-and-play Ethernet capability for when they were
parked in the maintenance bay for software updates and other
bandwidth-intensive operations. \\

An IPsec overlay secured with next-generation encryption provided strong
protection, and running Cisco EIGRP ensured fast failover between the
different transports. Using only IPv6, this network was fully dynamic and each
remote IR 819 and IR 829 had the exact same configuration. The headend used
IPv6 prefix delegation through DHCP to assign prefixes to each node. The
mobile routers, in turn, used these delegated prefixes to seed their stateless
address auto-configuration (SLAAC) processes for LAN clients. While the
solution did not introduce fog/edge compute or storage technology, it brought
an intelligent, dynamic, and scalable network to the most remote users. Future
plans for the design included small, ruggedized third-party servers with IoT
analytics software locally hosted to reduce gateway backhaul bandwidth
requirements. \\

Cisco also has products to perform edge aggregation and analytics, such as
Data in Motion (DMo). \textit{DMo is a software technology that provides data
management and first-order analysis at the edge.} DMo converts raw data to
useful/actionable information for transmission upstream. The previous section
discussed ``Data aggregation'' in greater detail, and DMo offers that
capability. DMo is a virtual machine which has RESTful API support, encrypted
transport options, and local caching capabilities. \\

Many IoT environments require a level of customization best suited for a
business' internal developers to build. Cisco's Kinetic Edge and Fog Module
(EFM) is a development platform that customers can use for operating and
managing their IoT networks. \textit{Kinetic EFM is a distributed
microservices platform for acquiring telemetry, moving it, analyzing it while
itâ€™s moving and putting it to rest.} The solution follows these main steps as
defined by Cisco:

\textit{
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extract data from its sources and makes it usable.
  \item Compute data to transform it, apply rules, and perform distributed micro-processing from edge to endpoint.
  \item Move data programmatically to the right applications at the right time.
\end{enumerate}
}

Furthermore, the solution has three main components:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{IoT message broker:} Utilizes publish/subscribe exchanges with
  endpoints. It has a small footprint and runs at the edge. It also supports
  various QoS levels to provide the correct treatment for applications.
  \item \textbf{Link:} Synonymous with ``microservice''. Many links already
  exist and are open source for Kinetic EFM developers to utilize. For more
  information on microservices, please review the ``containers'' section of
  this document.
  \item \textbf{Historian (formerly ParStream):} SQL style database which can
  scale massively for IoT. It has excellent performance and is well-suited to
  IoT architectures. The main drawback is that is only supports the INSERT
  operation, not transactional operations like UPDATE or DELETE. To rapidly
  retrieve information from the database, users have two options. One can send
  a query using the EFM as a query mechanism directly. Alternatively, one can
  form an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection directly to the
  Historian database.
\end{enumerate}
