&
Dependent on the protocol convergence times and redundancy in the network.
Doesnt matter how bad the SDN controller is  its failure is tolerable
&
Heavily reliant on a single SDN controller, unless one adds controllers to
split failure domains or to create resilience within a single failure domain
(which introduces a distributed control-plane in both cases)
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Granularity / control}
&
Generally low for IGPs but better for BGP. All devices generally need a common
view of the network to prevent loops independently. MPLS TE helps somewhat.
&
Better than distributed since policy injection can happen at the network edge,
or a small set of nodes. Can be combined with MPLS TE for more granular selection.
&
Moderately granular since SDN policy decisions are extended to all nodes. Can
influence decisions based on any arbitrary information within a datagram
&
Very highly granular; complete control over all routing decisions based on any
arbitrary information within a datagram
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Scalability}
&
Very high in a properly designed network (failure domain isolation, topology
summarization, reachability aggregation, etc)
&
High, but gets worse with more policy injection. Policies are generally
limited to key nodes (such as border routers)
&
Moderate, but gets worse with more policy injection. Policy is proliferated
across the network to all nodes (though the exact quantity may vary per node)
&
Depends; all devices retain state for all transiting flows. Hardware-dependent
on TCAM and whether SDN can use other tables such as L4 information, IPv6 flow
labels, etc

\textbf{Basic Description}
&
Five serial phases, no feedback
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Requirements
  \item Design
  \item Implementation
  \item Verification
  \item Maintenance
\end{enumerate}
&
Like the waterfall model, but operates in loops. This creates a feedback
mechanism at each cycle to promote a faster and more flexible process.
&
Advances when the current step/function/feature is complete; cyclical model.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Pros}
&
Simple, well understood, long history, requires minimal resources / management
oversight
&
Simple, well understood, opportunity to adjust, requires slightly more
resources than waterfall (but still reasonable)
&
Customer is engaged (better feedback), early detection of issues during rapid
code development periods (sprints)
\\ \midrule
\tetxbf{Cons}
&
Difficult to revert, customer is not engaged until the end, higher risk, slow
to deliver
&
Can be inefficient, customer feedback comes at the end of an iteration (not within)
&
High quantity of resources required, more focused management/customer
interaction needed
