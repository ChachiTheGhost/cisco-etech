## Purpose
This book is designed for anyone studying for the CCIE or CCDE certification
written exams. Since summer 2016, Cisco expert level written exams have
included 10% of their questions pulled from a new "evolving techologies"
topic domain. This book seeks to address that new section.

## Structure
TBD

## Tooling
Still being built, but uses a GNU `Makefile` for simplify linting and
typesetting functions. Alsu uses Travis CI for automated testing.

## FAQ
__Q__: Why was LaTeX chosen over simpler Markdown or reStructuredText?\
__A__: The end goal is to deliver a standalone PDF for offline and
independent viewing. Using Markdown, for example, requires tools like
`pandoc` and has very limited formatting options. Other solutions use
LaTeX as an intermediary anyway, so I felt it was easiest just to write
the source in LaTeX from the beginning.

__Q__: Why did you spend time to convert Microsoft Word to LaTeX anyway?\
__A__: As the book grew, I found it difficult using MS Word on my Macbook to
format things properly and get a consistent design without extensive
manual effort. Additionally, I find it very fitting that a book on "evolving
technologies" be written, maintained, updated, distributed, and tested as if
it were code. "Walk the walk", as it were.

__Q__: How does this book compare to other Cisco evolving tech books?\
__A__: Having not read any, I cannot comment directly. I encourage
readers to research the available options and decide for yourself. I will
say that this book goes far beyond what Cisco written exams typically
require. Readers will find it a useful field guide/reference for their
professional lives beyond a certification test.

__Q__: How often is the book updated?\
__A__: Traditionally, the book has been updated every 6 months, starting
in the summer of 2016 and continuing until the summer of 2018 (5 releases).
Given the new version control and pipeline design, releases may happen
more frequently, but I am not committing to any specific timeframes at
the time of this writing.

__Q__: Who covers your operating expenses for maintenance/updates?\
__A__: Given that the book is and always will be free, I fund everything with
the help of generous donations from others. If you like the book, like the
cause, like the concept, or just like me as a person, I'd encourae you to donate
